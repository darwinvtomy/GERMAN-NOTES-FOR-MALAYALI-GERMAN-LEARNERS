Certainly! Let's delve into each German case in detail with examples:

### German Cases (Deutsche FÃ¤lle)

**1. Nominativ (Nominative Case)**

- **Function:** The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence, which is the person or thing performing the action.

**Examples:**
- **Der Mann** liest ein Buch.  
  English: The man is reading a book.

- **Das Kind** spielt im Park.  
  English: The child is playing in the park.

In both examples, "Der Mann" and "Das Kind" are in the nominative case because they are the subjects of the sentences, performing the actions of reading and playing, respectively.

**2. Genitiv (Genitive Case)**

- **Function:** The genitive case indicates possession or ownership.

**Examples:**
- Das ist **das Auto meines Vaters**.  
  English: That is my father's car.

- Er ist **ein Freund meiner Schwester**.  
  English: He is a friend of my sister.

In these sentences, "meines Vaters" (my father's) and "meiner Schwester" (of my sister) are in the genitive case, indicating possession or association.

**3. Dativ (Dative Case)**

- **Function:** The dative case is used for the indirect object, indicating to whom or for whom something is done.

**Examples:**
- Er gibt **dem Lehrer** das Buch.  
  English: He gives the book to the teacher.

- Sie hilft **der alten Frau**.  
  English: She is helping the old woman.

In these examples, "dem Lehrer" (to the teacher) and "der alten Frau" (to the old woman) are in the dative case, indicating the recipients of the actions.

**4. Akkusativ (Accusative Case)**

- **Function:** The accusative case is used for the direct object, indicating who or what receives the action.

**Examples:**
- Sie liest **einen Roman**.  
  English: She is reading a novel.

- Ich sehe **den Mann**.  
  English: I see the man.

In these sentences, "einen Roman" (a novel) and "den Mann" (the man) are in the accusative case because they are the direct objects receiving the actions of reading and seeing, respectively.
